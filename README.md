# Duplicate Tab

Safari is my browser of choice on macOS. It's fast, native, beautifully designed, and doesn't devour RAM (Looking at you, Google Chrome). For all of its positives though, Safari has one feature that is glaringly missing, a core feature in all other modern browsers (even Opera)... the ability to duplicate a page in a new tab.

## Installation

You can either clone this repository and build it yourself with Xcode, or [download a notarized copy](https://fourpeaksstudios.io/duplicate-tab) with updates built-in.

## FAQ

### Surely there's already an app in the App Store that does this?

There is, but its icon is atrocious, and more importantly it doesn't recreate page state (i.e. scroll position) in the new tab. Duplicate Tab fixes both these issues.

### Why isn't Duplicate Tab in the App Store?

Apple apparently doesn't believe in competition, so not only am I distributing Duplicate Tab myself, I'm open-sourcing it as well! Pull requests are always welcome.

If you like Duplicate Tab and find it useful, [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/paysonwallach) (Or another adult beverage) and/or tell your friends! After all, there's bound to be at least one who's crazyâ€“I mean cool enough to be a fellow Safari user.
